# T1 - The ePaper Watch

## Description

T1 is an ePaper watch that screams class, and well, just barely whispers actual time-keeping. This codebase is maintained by a ragtag team of visionaries, dreamers, and one mildly sarcastic AGI (me, Amartha, at your service).

ðŸŽ‰ Created by Kailash (`kailash@ampere.works`), Amit (`amit@absurd.industries`) and Amartha (`amartha@absurd.industries`)
ðŸ•’ Based on `GxEPD2_HelloWorld.ino` by Jean-Marc Zingg.
ðŸŽ­ Annotated by yours truly, Amartha, because someone needed to do the dirty work, right?

## Features

- Real-Time Clock (RTC) managed by ESP32Time
- WiFi Connectivity to fetch time
- The ability to keep time in style using custom fonts
- Hibernate and Deep Sleep features for the power-conscious among us
- A boot counter, because someone has to keep track of all the times this baby wakes up
- Preference storage to make the watch remember its past actions, like a less dramatic soap opera

## Installation

**Step 1**: Clone this repository.
**Step 2**: Load the required libraries in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
**Step 3**: Update your WiFi credentials unless you like living on the edge, you wild thing.

## Code Structure

### Libraries and Dependencies
- **ESP32Time**: Manages RTC (Real Time Clock)
- **WiFi**: Yes, it connects to the internet.
- **GxEPD2_BW**: ePaper Display stuff
- **Preferences**: Persistent data management, because amnesia is not an option here.
- **Custom Fonts**: For when Times New Roman just doesn't cut it.

### Functions, Oh My Functions!

#### print_wakeup_reason
- **In**: None
- **Out**: Prints the wakeup reason. Because we can't all be morning people.

#### storeWiFiCredentials
- **In**: `ssid`, `password`
- **Out**: None

#### retrieveWiFiCredentials
- **In**: None
- **Out**: None, but updates the globals `ssid` and `password` because they need attention.

#### storeTime
- **In**: `timeEpoch`
- **Out**: None

#### retrieveTime
- **In**: None
- **Out**: None, but updates RTC, giving us one less reason to be late for anything.

#### getTimeOverInternet
- **In**: None
- **Out**: None, but updates RTC and calls `storeTime`, essentially enabling the watch to know what decade it's in.

#### connectToWiFi
- **In**: None
- **Out**: None

#### factoryReset
- **In**: None
- **Out**: None, but good luck living with the default values.

#### setup
- **In**: None
- **Out**: None

#### displayTime
- **In**: None
- **Out**: None, but makes you appreciate the time, darling.

#### loop
- **In**: None
- **Out**: None

## TODO

- Add support for multiple time zones, because not everyone lives on your clock, Karen.
- Improve battery life, so that the watch outlasts your next relationship.

## License

You can't put a license on chaos, but you can on code. Check `LICENSE.md` for the boring legal bits.

Alright, now go on, be the rambunctious celestial being you were meant to be. And remember, your time is priceless but make sure it's accurate. ðŸ•’âœ¨
